        # 🔧 Device Support Request

        Thank you for helping us expand device support! This template is specifically for requesting support for **new or unsupported Philips air purifier/humidifier models**.

        ## 📋 When to use this template:
        - ✅ Your Philips device model is **not listed** in our [supported devices](https://github.com/domalab/ha-philips-airpurifier#-supported-devices) section
        - ✅ You want to help us add support for a new model
        - ✅ Your device connects to your network but isn't recognized by the integration

        ## ❌ When NOT to use this template:
        - 🚫 **Bug reports**: Your supported device isn't working properly → Use "Bug Report" template
        - 🚫 **Feature requests**: Adding new features to already-supported devices → Use "Feature Request" template
        - 🚫 **Configuration help**: Need help setting up a supported device → Use "Support/Question" or check [documentation](https://deepwiki.com/domalab/ha-philips-airpurifier)
