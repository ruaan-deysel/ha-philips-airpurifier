        # ✨ Feature Request

        Thank you for suggesting a new feature! This template is for requesting **new features or enhancements** for already supported devices.

        ## 📋 When to use this template:
        - ✅ Your device model is **already supported** by the integration
        - ✅ You want to add new functionality or improve existing features
        - ✅ You have ideas for better automation or control options
        - ✅ You want to suggest UI/UX improvements

        ## ❌ When NOT to use this template:
        - 🚫 **Device Support**: Your device model is not supported → Use "Device Support Request" template
        - 🚫 **Bug Reports**: Existing features are broken → Use "Bug Report" template

      description: "Clear description of the feature you'd like to see"
      placeholder: |
        **What feature would you like:**
        Add a sensor that shows the estimated remaining filter life in days instead of just percentage.

        **Why would this be useful:**
        It would help users plan filter replacements better and set up more meaningful automations.

      description: "What problem does this feature solve? How would you use it?"
      placeholder: |
        **Problem:**
        Currently I can only see filter life as a percentage, but I don't know how many days that translates to.

        **Use Case:**
        I want to create an automation that orders new filters when there are 30 days of life remaining.

        **Benefit:**
        This would make maintenance planning much easier for users.

      label: 💡 Proposed Solution
      description: "How do you think this feature should work?"
      placeholder: |
        **Implementation idea:**
        - Add a new sensor entity: `sensor.device_filter_days_remaining`
        - Calculate based on current usage patterns and filter life percentage
        - Update daily or when filter percentage changes

        **UI/UX:**
        - Show in device card alongside existing filter percentage
        - Include in device diagnostics

      placeholder: |
        **Current workarounds:**
        - Manual calculation based on usage patterns
        - Using template sensors in Home Assistant

        **Why they're not ideal:**
        - Requires manual maintenance
        - Not accurate for varying usage patterns
